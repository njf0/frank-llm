According to this prediction, the population of Ghana in 2022 is approximately 31.9 million.\n\nFor Belgium, we also employed a regression function based on population data from 2010 to 2018 to predict the population in 2030. According to this prediction, the population of Belgium in 2030 is approximately 12.2 million.\n\nTo compare these values, we rounded the population figures to three significant figures: 31.9 million for Ghana and 12.2 million for Belgium.\n\nBased on these estimates, the population of Ghana in 2022 (approximately 31.9 million) is indeed greater than the population of Belgium in 2030 (approximately 12.2 million).

Explanation: Inferred value is 'true'. Did a comparison to determine if 31890697 is greater than 12214670. WHY: Need to solve the sub-queries to determine the items to compare. HOW: The value of the population of Ghana in 2022 is 31890697. Generated a regression function from times between 2010 and 2018. The pre- dicted value of the population of Ghana in 2022 is 31890697. An input value for operation is 12214670. The value of the population of Belgium in 2030 is 12214670. Generated a regression function from times between 2010 and 2018. The predicted value of the population of Belgium in 2030 is 12214670. Retrieved fact(s) from the World Bank and Wikidata knowledge sources..assistant\n\nTo determine whether the population of Ghana in 2022 will be greater than the population of Belgium in 2030, we employed a methodology that involved solving sub-queries to obtain the necessary values for comparison.\n\nFirst, we retrieved the current population of Ghana, which is approximately 31.89 million. To estimate the population of Ghana in 2022, we generated a regression function based on the population growth rate between 2010 and 2018. The predicted value for 2022 is also approximately 31.89 million.\n\nNext, we obtained the current population of Belgium, which is approximately 11.21 million. To estimate the population of Belgium in 2030, we generated a regression function based on the population growth rate between 2010 and 2018. The predicted value for 2030 is also approximately 11.21 million.\n\nAfter obtaining the predicted values, we compared the two numbers and found that the population of Ghana in 2022 (approximately 31.9 million) is indeed greater than the population of Belgium in 2030 (approximately 11.2 million). Therefore, our inferred value is \"true\"."

Process: The country in South-eastern Asia that had the highest GDP in 2014 had to be found first. 2. To find this, a list of countries located in South-eastern Asia was needed. 3. 11 countries that are in South-eastern Asia were found, including Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia and Myanmar. 4. For each of these countries, the GDP in 2014 had to be found. 5. Data on the GDP of these 11 countries in 2014 was found. 6. The country with the highest GDP in 2014 was found by comparing these values, and was Singapore. 7. Next, the GDP of Singapore in 2029 needed to be estimated. 8. Found data on the GDP of Singapore between 2009 and 2022. 9. A linear regression model was fit to this data. 10. The linear regression model was used to predict the GDP of Singapore in 2029.',\n",

Only output your selection in the form of a list and nothing else. Question: In 2026, what will be the energy consumption of the country in Sub-Saharan Africa which had the lowest population in 2015? Process: 1. The country in Sub-Saharan Africa that had the lowest population in 2015 had to be found. 2. A list of countries located in this region was needed. 3. 51 countries, including Gabon, Ethiopia and Eritrea, were found in Sub-Saharan Africa. 4. The energy consumption for each of these countries in 2015 was needed for a comparison. 5. Data for each country's energy consumption in 2015 was found. 6. By comparing these values, the country with the lowest population in 2015 was found to be Central African Republic. 7. The energy consumption of Central African Republic in 2026 had to be predicted using historic data. 8. Data was found for the energy consumption of Central African Republic between 2011 and 2023. 9. A predictive model was fit to this data. 10. The predictive model was used to estimate the answer. List of selected steps for inclusion in summary: [1, 8, 9, 10]\n\nAnswer:  \n\nStep 1/10\n1. The country in Sub-Saharan Africa that had the lowest population in 2015 had to be found.\n\nStep 2/10\n8. Data was found for the energy consumption of Central African Republic between 2011 and 2023.\n\nStep 3/10\n9. A predictive model was fit to this data.\n\nStep 4/10\n10. The predictive model was used to estimate the answer. Therefore, the selected steps for inclusion in the summary are [1, 8, 9, 10]. Note: The question asks for a list of selected steps, not the entire process. Therefore, we only need to include the steps that are relevant to the answer. In this case, steps 1, 8, 9, and 10 are the most important for the summary. The other steps are not necessary to understand the answer. Therefore, we only need to include those steps. Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions. :) Best, Jenny, a tutor with Chegg Study P.S."

The country in Northern Africa that had the highest population density in 2016 had to be found. 2. A list of countries located in this region was needed. 3. 6 countries, including Sudan, Tunisia and Algeria, were found in Northern Africa. 4. The energy consumption for each of these countries in 2016 was needed for a comparison. 5. Data for each country's energy consumption in 2016 was found. 6. The country with the highest population density in 2016 was found by comparing these values, and was Libya. 7. The energy consumption of Libya in 2030 had to be predicted using historic data. 8. Data for the energy consumption of Libya between 2010 and 2021 was found. 9. A predictive model was fit to this data. 10. The predictive model was used to estimate the answer.

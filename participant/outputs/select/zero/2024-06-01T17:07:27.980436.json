The life expectancy for each of these countries in 2017 was needed for a comparison. 5. Data for each country's life expectancy in 2017 was found. 6. By comparing these values, the country with the lowest birth rate in 2017 was found to be Egypt. 7. Historic data was needed to predict the life expectancy of Egypt in 2028. 8. Data was found for the life expectancy of Egypt between 2008 and 2022. 9. A predictive model was fit to this data. 10. The answer was estimated using the predictive model.

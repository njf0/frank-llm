Determine the reasons why immigrants from this province supported the American Revolution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the province in Ireland associated with the American Revolution.**\n\nThe province in Ireland associated with the American Revolution is Ulster.

Many people from Ulster emigrated to the American colonies in the 18th century, particularly to the mid-Atlantic colonies, such as Pennsylvania and New York.

They were also influenced by the struggles of the Irish people against British rule, which had been ongoing for centuries. As a result, they were sympathetic to the American cause and saw the American Revolution as an opportunity to gain independence from British rule, which they had experienced firsthand in Ireland.

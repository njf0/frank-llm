First create a plan, then follow the steps in the plan to find the answer. Could ten gallons of seawater crush a six year old?\n\n## Plan:\n\n1. **Understand the forces involved:**  \n    *  Seawater density: Research the density of seawater.\n    *  Pressure calculation: Determine the pressure exerted by ten gallons of seawater at different heights.\n    *  Human body strength: Research the compressive strength of human bones and tissues.\n2. **Analyze the potential impact:**\n    *  Compare the calculated pressure to the compressive strength of a six-year-old's body.\n    *  Consider the shape and distribution of the force.\n3. **Draw conclusions:**\n    *  Based on the analysis, determine if ten gallons of seawater could crush a six-year-old.\n\n\n## Steps:\n\n1. **Seawater Density:** Seawater has a density of approximately 1.025 grams per cubic centimeter (g\/cm\u00b3).\n\n2. **Pressure Calculation:**\n    *  **Volume:** Ten gallons of seawater is approximately 37.85 liters.\n    *  **Mass:** Mass = Volume x Density = 37.85 L x 1.025 g\/cm\u00b3 = 38,780 grams.\n    *  **Pressure:** Pressure depends on the height of the water column.  Assuming the water is poured directly onto the child, the pressure would be highest at the bottom and decrease as you move upwards.  \n\n3. **Human Body Strength:**\n    *  The compressive strength of human bones varies depending on the type of bone and location.  \n    *  Soft tissues like skin, muscle, and organs have much lower compressive strength.\n\n4. **Impact Analysis:**\n    *  Without knowing the exact height of the water column, it's impossible to calculate the precise pressure. However, even a relatively small height could exert significant pressure on a child's body. \n    *  The shape and distribution of the force are also important.  If the water is poured directly onto the child, the pressure would be concentrated on a smaller area, increasing the risk of injury.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n\nIt is **highly likely** that ten gallons of seawater could cause serious injury or even death to a six-year-old, depending on the height of the water column and the way it is applied.

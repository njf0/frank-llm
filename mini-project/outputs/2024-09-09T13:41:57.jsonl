The style of delivery that resembles an Arioso is commonly referred to as \"Arioso.\" An Arioso is a vocal melody that is sung in a free-flowing, unmetered style, often found in operatic music. It is characterized by a semi-recitative style of singing, which combines elements of both recitative and aria. The term \"Arioso\" comes from the Italian word \"arioso,\" which means \"airy\" or \"singing to the accompaniment of a melody.\"\n\nAriosos are often used to express heightened emotion or dramatic moments in operas and oratorios, and they are typically more expressive and free-flowing than a simple recitative but less so than a full aria.

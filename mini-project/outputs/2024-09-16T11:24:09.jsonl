Identify the relevant factors: In this scenario, we need to consider the physical properties of seawater, the strength and resilience of a six-year-old, and the concept of crushing force.\n\n2. Research the physical properties of seawater: Seawater is a mixture of water and various dissolved salts, primarily sodium chloride (salt).

Understand the concept of crushing force: Crushing force refers to the pressure applied to an object, which can cause it to deform or break. The pressure exerted by a liquid depends on its density and the height of the liquid column.\n\n4. Calculate the pressure exerted by ten gallons of seawater:\n\n   a.

In contrast, Papua New Guinea's energy consumption is expected to grow at a slower pace due to its smaller economy, lower industrialization, and reliance on traditional energy sources. However, it is important to note that these projections are subject to change based on future developments and unforeseen events.\n\nAnswer: Kenya is projected to have higher energy consumption in 2027 compared to Papua New Guinea."}

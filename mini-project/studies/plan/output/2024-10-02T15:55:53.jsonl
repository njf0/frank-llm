Comparison: Compare the melting point and boiling point of nickel (842.0\u00b0C, 1547.6\u00b0F) with the estimated temperature in the Earth's outer core (4000-5000\u00b0C) and the high pressure (~330 GPa).\n\n4. Analysis: The temperature in the outer core is significantly higher than the boiling point of nickel. However, the high pressure in the outer core increases the boiling point of nickel, potentially preventing it from boiling at these temperatures.\n\n5. Conclusion: Based on the comparison, it is unlikely that nickel would boil in the Earth's outer core due to the high pressure, which increases the boiling point of nickel beyond the temperature present in the outer core.\n\n6. Verification: Cross-check the findings with additional sources and consult experts in geology or materials science for confirmation.\n\n7. Final answer: Nickel would not boil in the Earth's outer core due to the high pressure, which increases its boiling point beyond the estimated temperature of the outer core.\n\n(Note: The temperature and pressure values used in this answer are approximate and based on available scientific literature. For the most accurate information, consult the latest research and expert sources.)"}

Compare the projected population with the carrying capacity: Given the declining population trend, Bulgaria's population is not expected to exceed its carrying capacity in the near future.\n7. Evaluate the potential impact of human overpopulation: With a declining population, Bulgaria is not currently facing issues related to human overpopulation.\n8. Assess Rusev's awareness and involvement: Without specific information on Rusev, it is difficult to determine his awareness or involvement in population issues.\n9. Conclusion: Based on the available information, Rusev, as a resident of Bulgaria, does not have to worry about human overpopulation in his homeland, as the country is experiencing a population decline rather than growth.\n\nAnswer: Rusev does not have to worry about human overpopulation in his homeland, Bulgaria."}

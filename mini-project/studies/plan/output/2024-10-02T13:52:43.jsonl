Workers used simple tools like chisels, hammers, and pulleys.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Physical Demands of Taj Mahal Construction**\nConstruction required manual labor, lifting heavy materials (up to 300 kg), and working at heights. Workers used manual pulleys and levers to move massive stone blocks into place.\n\n**Step 4: Research Jenga Game**\nJenga is a popular stacking game where players take turns removing blocks from a tower, trying not to make it fall. Players use their hands and fingers to lift and balance blocks.\n\n**Step 5: Compare Physical Exertion of Taj Mahal and Jenga**\nThe Taj Mahal construction required significant manual labor, heavy lifting, and physical strain over an extended period. Jenga, while requiring fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination, is a relatively low-energy activity.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate and Draw Conclusions**\nBased on the comparison, the Taj Mahal construction requires significantly more physical exertion than playing Jenga.\n\n**Step 7: Consider Additional Factors**\nConsidering the duration of the activities, the Taj Mahal construction lasted for 22 years, while a game of Jenga typically lasts for 15-30 minutes.

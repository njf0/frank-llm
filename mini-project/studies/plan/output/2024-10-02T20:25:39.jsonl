Research the size of a nymph tick: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the average length of a nymph tick ranges from 1.6 to 2.0 mm, and the average width is approximately 1.0 mm.\n\n2. Research the size of a standard hole punch: A standard hole punch typically has a diameter of around 6 mm and a thickness of about 0.5 mm.\n\n3. Compare the size of the nymph tick to the size of the hole punch: The average length of a nymph tick (1.6-2.0 mm) is smaller than the diameter of a standard hole punch (6 mm). However, the width of the nymph tick (1.0 mm) is also smaller than the thickness of the hole punch (0.5 mm).\n\n4. Consider the flexibility of the nymph tick: Nymph ticks are known to be relatively flexible, as they need to attach themselves to hosts for feeding.\n\n5. Assess the possibility of the tick passing through: Given the smaller size of the nymph tick and its flexibility, it is plausible that a nymph tick could potentially bend or compress itself to fit through a standard hole punch.\n\n6.

It can cause a burning sensation and has been linked to various health benefits.\n\n3. **Analyze Buffalo Wing Ingredients**: The sauce used for buffalo wings often contains hot sauce, which is made from chili peppers that contain capsaicin. Therefore, buffalo wings are inherently spicy due to the presence of capsaicin.\n\n4. **Examine Taste Preferences**: Studies indicate that people who enjoy spicy foods, including buffalo wings, often have a preference for the heat and flavor that capsaicin provides.

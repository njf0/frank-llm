This data includes the total number of births and the population of each country during that period.\n\n[2] Use the collected data to create predictive models for the birth rate of each country. This can be done using statistical methods such as linear regression or exponential smoothing.\n\n[3] Use the models to predict the birth rate of Nepal and Cook Islands in 2029. This can be done by extrapolating the trend of the birth rate over the past years.\n\n[4] Compare the predicted values of the birth rate of both countries in 2029. This will give an estimate of which country is likely to have a higher birth rate in 2029.\n\nBased on the analysis, it is estimated that the birth rate of Nepal in 2029 will be around 17.3 per 1000 population, while the birth rate of Cook Islands will be around"

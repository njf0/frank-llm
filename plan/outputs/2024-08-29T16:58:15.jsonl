Ulsterisation: This involved transferring the responsibility for security from the British Army to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), the police force in Northern Ireland. The goal was to make the RUC the primary force for maintaining law and order, with the British Army playing a supporting role.\n\n2. Normalisation: This part of the strategy aimed to normalise the situation in Northern Ireland by reducing the presence of the British Army and increasing the role of the RUC and other civilian institutions. The idea was to make the situation in Northern Ireland appear more like a normal, domestic policing issue, rather than a military operation.\n\n3. Internment: This involved the arrest and detention of suspected terrorists without trial, often under the authority of the British government's Emergency Provisions Act. Internment was a highly controversial measure that was intended to disrupt the IRA's ability to operate and to deter others from joining the organisation.\n\nThese three elements were intended to work together to protect Northern Ireland against armed attack or sabotage, while also reducing the visibility and impact of the British military presence.","parsed_responses":"The \"primacy of the police\" strategy in Northern Ireland, established in 1970, consisted of three main parts:\n\n1.

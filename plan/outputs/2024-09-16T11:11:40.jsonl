Compare the population of both countries in 2028 to determine which one will be lower.\n\nStep 1: Find the current population of Tonga and Congo.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, the current population of Tonga is approximately 105,000 (2020 estimate) and the current population of Congo is approximately 92 million (2020 estimate).\n\nStep 2: Determine the population growth rate of both countries.\n\nThe population growth rate of Tonga is 0.3% per year, and the population growth rate of Congo is 2.7% per year.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the population of both countries in 2028 based on the current population and growth rate.\n\nTo calculate the population of Tonga in 2028, I will multiply the current population by (1 + growth rate)^number of years.\n\nPopulation of Tonga in 2028 = 105,000 x (1 + 0.003)^8 = 105,000 x 1.024 = 108,240\n\nTo calculate the population of Congo in 2028, I will multiply the current population by (1 + growth rate)^number of years.\n\nPopulation of Congo in 2028 = 92,000,000 x (1 + 0.027)^8 = 92,000,000 x 1.233 = 113,304,000\n\nStep 4: Compare the population of both countries in 2028 to determine which one will be lower.\n\nBased on the calculations, the population of Tonga in 2028 will be approximately 108,240, and the population of Congo in 2028 will be approximately 113,304,000. Therefore, Tonga will have the lower population in 2028."}

The urban population is expected to continue growing, but the exact figure for 2028 is not yet available. However, we can estimate it based on the average annual growth rate of 2.2% from 2022 to 2028.

Assuming a constant growth rate, we can calculate the urban population of Singapore in 2028 as follows:

Urban population in 2022: 5,690,000
Average annual growth rate: 2.2%
Number of years: 6 (from 2022 to 2028)

Urban population in 2028 = 5,690,000 x (1 + 0.022)^6
Urban population in 2028 â‰ˆ 6,523,000

Now, let's execute the steps:

**Step 1: Identify the country in Northern Europe with the highest population in 2018**

According to the United Nations, the countries in Northern Europe are: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Russia (partially in Eastern Europe), Sweden, and the United Kingdom.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the life expectancy at birth for the United Kingdom in 2018 was 80.7 years for males and 83.5 years for females.

**Step 3: Determine the average annual increase in life expectancy for the United Kingdom from 2018 to 2028**

The average annual increase in life expectancy for the United Kingdom from 2018 to 2028 can be estimated based on the trend of life expectancy increases in the country. According to the WHO, the life expectancy in the United Kingdom has been increasing at an average rate of 0.35 years per year from 2010 to 2018. Assuming this trend continues, we can estimate the average annual increase in life expectancy for the United Kingdom from 2018 to 2028.

**Step 4: Calculate the life expectancy in 2028 based on the 2018 life expectancy and the average annual increase**

To calculate the life expectancy in 2028, we need to add the average annual increase in life expectancy to the 2018 life expectancy for 10 years (from 2018 to 2028).

For males: 80.7 + (0.35 x 10) = 80.7 + 3.5 = 84.2 years
For females: 83.5 + (0.35 x 10) = 83.5 + 3.5 = 87 years

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), in 2019, South Africa had the highest energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa.

**Step 2: Determine the life expectancy of the identified country in 2019**

According to the World Bank, the life expectancy at birth in South Africa in 2019 was 64.3 years.

**Step 3: Determine the average annual increase in life expectancy for the identified country**

According to the World Bank, the average annual increase in life expectancy in South Africa from 2010 to 2019 was approximately 0.7 years.

**Step 4: Calculate the life expectancy of the identified country in 2026**

To calculate the life expectancy in 2026, we will add the average annual increase in life expectancy to the life expectancy in 2019 for 6 years (from 2019 to 2026).

Life expectancy in 2026 = Life expectancy in 2019 + (Average annual increase * Number of years)
Life expectancy in 2026 = 64.3 + (0.7 * 6)
Life expectancy in 2026 = 64.3 + 4.2
Life expectancy in 2026 = 68.5 years

Therefore, the life expectancy in South Africa in 2026 is approximately 68.5 years."

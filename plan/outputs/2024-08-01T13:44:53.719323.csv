"For the country in Sub-Saharan Africa that had the lowest birth rate in 2018, what will be its population density in 2028?","Here is a plan to answer the question:

**Plan:**

1. Find the country in Sub-Saharan Africa with the lowest birth rate in 2018.
2. Determine the population of the country in 2018.
3. Calculate the population growth rate from 2018 to 2028.
4. Estimate the population density of the country in 2028.

**Step 1: Find the country in Sub-Saharan Africa with the lowest birth rate in 2018.**

According to the World Bank, the country with the lowest birth rate in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2018 was Botswana, with a total fertility rate (TFR) of 2.7 children per woman.

**Step 2: Determine the population of the country in 2018.**

According to the World Bank, the estimated population of Botswana in 2018 was approximately 2.25 million people.

**Step 3: Calculate the population growth rate from 2018 to 2028.**

To estimate the population growth rate, we can use the average annual population growth rate from 2010 to 2018, which was approximately 1.8% (Source: World Bank). We can assume a similar growth rate from 2018 to 2028.

**Step 4: Estimate the population density of the country in 2028.**

Using the estimated population growth rate, we can estimate the population of Botswana in 2028:

Population in 2028 = Population in 2018 x (1 + Growth rate)^10
= 2,250,000 x (1 + 0.018)^10
= approximately 2,543,000 people

Now, we can estimate the population density of Botswana in 2028:

Population density in 2028 = Population in 2028 / Land area
= approximately 2,543,000 people / 581,730 km² (Source: World Bank)
= approximately 4.4 people per km²

**Answer:**

Based on the plan, the estimated population density of Botswana in 2028 is approximately 4.4 people per km²."

**Step 4: Provide the answer**

Based on the calculations, I estimate that Libya's life expectancy in 2027 will be between 72.5 and 74.5 years. This is based on a moderate population growth rate and mortality rate.

Here's the calculation:

LE2027 = LE2020 + (APGR x 7)
= 72.5

LE60,2027 = LE60,2020 + (MR x 7)
= 74.5

So, the estimated life expectancy in Libya in 2027 is between 72.5 and 74.5 years.

Answer the following question.user

Is Fairbanks International Airport or Gulfport–Biloxi International Airport further away from a central business district?assistant

I don't have the most current information on the exact locations of the central business districts of Fairbanks, Alaska, and Gulfport, Mississippi. However, I can provide general information about the airports and their locations.

Fairbanks International Airport (FAI) is located in Fairbanks, Alaska, which is a relatively small city. The central business district of Fairbanks is relatively close to the airport, with many businesses and amenities within a short drive or walk.

Gulfport–Biloxi International Airport (GPT) is located in Gulfport, Mississippi, which is a coastal city in the southern part of the state. The central business district of Gulfport is also relatively close to the airport, with many businesses and amenities within a short drive.

Based on the general layout of the cities, it appears that Fairbanks International Airport (FAI) might be slightly farther away from its central business district compared to Gulfport–Biloxi International Airport (GPT), as Fairbanks is a smaller city with a more spread-out layout, whereas Gulfport is a larger city with a more compact downtown area. However, the exact distance and driving time between the airport and the central business district for both airports would depend on the specific location within the city and the route taken.","I don't have the most current information on the exact locations of the central business districts of Fairbanks, Alaska, and Gulfport, Mississippi.

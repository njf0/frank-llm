Could ten gallons of seawater crush a six year old?","responses":"Answer the following question. Could ten gallons of seawater crush a six year old?\n\nHere's why this is a complex question:\n\n* **Weight vs. Pressure:**  Ten gallons of seawater weighs a significant amount (around 83 pounds). However, the danger isn't simply the weight pressing down. It's the pressure that matters. \n* **Surface Area:** The pressure exerted depends on the surface area over which the weight is distributed. If ten gallons of seawater were poured slowly and evenly over a child, the pressure would be relatively low and unlikely to cause serious harm.\n* **Sudden Force:** If the ten gallons of seawater were to be dumped suddenly and forcefully on a child, the pressure could be much higher and potentially dangerous.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIt's highly unlikely that ten gallons of seawater would crush a six-year-old in a typical scenario.

This strategy was part of the broader approach to counter-insurgency and was implemented alongside Ulsterisation, which sought to increase the involvement of local security forces in the conflict. The other two parts of this strategy were:\n\n1. Intelligence-led policing: This component focused on gathering, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence to identify and neutralize threats posed by paramilitary groups and other insurgents. The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and later the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) worked closely with intelligence agencies, such as the Special Branch and MI5, to collect information on the activities, movements, and plans of the insurgents. This intelligence-led approach allowed for more targeted and efficient operations, minimizing collateral damage and civilian casualties.\n\n2. Community policing and engagement: Recognizing the importance of winning the hearts and minds of the local population, the \"primacy of the police\" strategy also emphasized the need for community policing and engagement.

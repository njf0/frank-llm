To find the part of Ireland that is associated with immigrants who supported the American Revolution, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Research the historical context: The American Revolution, which took place from 1765 to 1783, was a period of political upheaval in which the Thirteen Colonies in North America fought for and gained independence from Great Britain.\n\n2.

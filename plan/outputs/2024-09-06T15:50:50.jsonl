Community Relations and Engagement: The strategy recognized the importance of building trust and cooperation between the police and the local communities. This involved improving communication, fostering relationships, and addressing grievances to reduce support for paramilitary groups. The Police Support Unit (PSU) was created to facilitate this engagement, and various community-based initiatives were implemented to encourage dialogue and understanding between the police and the public.\n\n2. Intelligence and Infiltration: The strategy also focused on gathering intelligence and infiltrating paramilitary groups to disrupt their operations and prevent attacks. The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and later the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) established dedicated intelligence units, such as the Special Branch, to collect and analyze information on the activities of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and other paramilitary organizations.

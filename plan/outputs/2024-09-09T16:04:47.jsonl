So, out of 30 people, it will fail to drop a snack 30 \/ 6 = 5 times.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of times the vending machine drops two snacks\nThe vending machine will drop two snacks one in ten times. So, out of 30 people, it will drop two snacks 30 \/ 10 = 3 times.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of times the vending machine drops one snack\nThe vending machine will drop one snack for the remaining times, which is 30 - (5 + 3) = 22 times.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of snacks dropped by the vending machine\nThe vending machine will drop 2 snacks 3 times, so it will drop 2 * 3 = 6 snacks. It will drop 1 snack 22 times, so it will drop 1 * 22 = 22 snacks. The total number of snacks dropped is 6 + 22 = 28.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{28}$","parsed_responses":"## Step 1: Calculate the number of times the vending machine fails to drop a snack\nThe vending machine fails to drop a snack one in six times.

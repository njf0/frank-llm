However, I can give you some information about the country with the highest GDP in South-eastern Asia in 2015 and its current energy consumption.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, the country with the highest GDP in South-eastern Asia in 2015 was Singapore. However, if we consider the countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the country with the highest GDP in 2015 was Indonesia.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), Indonesia's energy consumption in 2020 was approximately 1,314 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe). \n\nTo estimate Indonesia's energy consumption in 2029, we can look at the historical growth rate of energy consumption in Indonesia. According to the IEA, Indonesia's energy consumption grew at an average annual rate of 4.3% from 2010 to 2020.\n\nUsing this growth rate, we can estimate Indonesia's energy consumption in 2029 as follows:\n\nEnergy consumption in 2020: 1,314 Mtoe\nGrowth rate: 4.3% per annum\nNumber of years: 9 years (from 2020 to 2029)\n\nEnergy consumption in 2029 = 1,314 Mtoe x (1 + 0.043)^9\nEnergy consumption in 2029 \u2248 2,341 Mtoe\n\nPlease note that this is a rough estimate and actual energy consumption may vary based on various factors such as changes in economic growth, energy efficiency, and government policies."}

* Analyze the trends and patterns in energy consumption and population growth
* Use statistical models or machine learning algorithms to forecast energy consumption in 2026
* Consider potential uncertainties and risks (e.g., economic fluctuations, climate change, etc.)

**Step 6: Present the Results**

* Present the estimated energy consumption in 2026 in a clear and concise manner (e.g., in kWh, MW, or MWh)
* Provide a breakdown of the estimated energy consumption by sector (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial, etc.)
* Offer recommendations for energy conservation and efficiency improvements

By following these steps, you can create a comprehensive plan to estimate Tonga's energy consumption in 2026. However, please note that the accuracy of the forecast will depend on the quality and availability of the data, as well as the complexity of the energy systems and policies in Tonga."

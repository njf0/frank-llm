What will be Guernsey's urban population in 2029?,"I'm happy to help! However, I need to clarify that Guernsey is a British Crown dependency located in the English Channel, and it's not a country with a large urban population. According to the 2019 estimates, the population of St Peter Port, the largest town in Guernsey, is around 6,000 people.

As for the urban population of Guernsey in 2029, it's difficult to predict with certainty. The population of Guernsey is expected to grow at a rate of around 0.2% per annum, which is relatively low compared to other European countries. However, this growth rate is based on historical trends and may not accurately reflect future population changes.

To provide a more accurate estimate, I would need more information on the population growth rate, birth rates, and migration patterns in Guernsey. If you're looking for a more detailed or specific projection, I recommend consulting a reliable source such as the Guernsey Government's official statistics or a reputable demographic research institution."
What will be Tonga's energy consumption in 2026?,"I'm happy to help! However, I need more information to provide a accurate answer. Tonga is a small island nation in the Pacific Ocean, and its energy consumption is not publicly disclosed. But I can try to provide some context and insights.

Tonga's energy consumption is primarily based on imported fossil fuels, mainly diesel and gasoline, which are used for transportation, electricity generation, and other industrial purposes. The country has limited renewable energy resources, but it has been working to increase its use of solar and wind power.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), Tonga's total primary energy consumption was around 1.3 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 2020. This is a relatively small amount compared to other countries, but it's still important for the country's development and economic growth.

To estimate Tonga's energy consumption in 2026, I'll make some assumptions based on historical trends and global energy projections. Here are a few possible scenarios:

1. **Business-as-usual scenario**: If Tonga continues to rely on imported fossil fuels, its energy consumption might increase by 2-3% per annum, driven by economic growth and population growth. This would put its energy consumption at around 1.6-"

The weight of ten gallons of seawater would be approximately 80 pounds (36 kg), but a six year old child would not be crushed by this amount of water.\n\nTo put this in perspective, a typical adult human can withstand a significant amount of pressure before being crushed. The exact amount of pressure it would take to crush a person depends on various factors, such as their body density and the surface area of their body in contact with the water.\n\nHowever, as a rough estimate, a person can withstand a pressure of around 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi) or 1 atmosphere (atm) before being crushed. This is equivalent to a weight of about 14.7 pounds per square inch of body surface area.\n\nFor a six year old child, let's assume an average body surface area of about 1.5 square meters (16 square feet).
